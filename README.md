# Color Detection Project 
Application where you can get the name of a color in an image by double clicking the pixel. We use a data file that has every color name and value to determine the color. 

# How does it work? 
To determine the color, the code calculates the distance from each color and detect the shortest one to determine the color of the pixel. Something similar to this is used in various photo editing and drawing apps like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.
